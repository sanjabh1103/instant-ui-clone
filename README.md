| created_at   | timestamp  | Deployment creation time          |
| updated_at   | timestamp  | Last update time                  |

Row Level Security (RLS) is **enabled** on all tables: each user can see only their own data by default!

### Supabase Authentication

- Email/password login and registration (no social logins by default)
- Make sure "Confirm email" is *disabled* in Supabase settings for easier onboarding/testing
- Redirects back to "/" upon success
- Guest users can view only informational UI, not saved projects

### Running & Developing

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account
- Google Gemini API key
- Vercel/Netlify account (for deployment features)

**Local development:**

1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see below)
4. Set up Supabase project and run migrations
5. `npm run dev` to start local dev environment
6. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

**Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# AI API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# Optional: Deployment tokens (user provides these in UI)
# VERCEL_TOKEN=your-vercel-token-here
# NETLIFY_TOKEN=your-netlify-token-here
```

**Supabase Setup:**

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the migrations in `/supabase/migrations/` in order
3. Enable Row Level Security on all tables
4. Set up authentication providers (email/password enabled by default)
5. Create storage bucket: `project-images` with public access
6. Set up edge functions: `interpret-sketch` and `deploy`

**Database Tables:**
- `projects` - Core project data with generated code
- `deployments` - Deployment tracking and URLs
- Apply all migrations in chronological order

## File Structure

All new React components should be atomic and conciseâ€”avoid "giant" files. Here are some key files/components and what they do:

### Core Pages
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` â€” Main application hub with premium hero section
- `src/pages/ProjectPage.tsx` â€” Project editor with Monaco code editor and deployment
- `src/pages/Auth.tsx` â€” Authentication page

### Components
- `src/components/CodeEditor.tsx` â€” Monaco-based code editor with syntax highlighting
- `src/components/SketchUploader.tsx` â€” Handles image file selection and preview
- `src/components/PromptPanel.tsx` â€” AI prompt UI for describing the app
- `src/components/PastGenerations.tsx`, `PastGenerationActions.tsx` â€” List, reload, rename, and delete previous generations
- `src/components/GeneratedPreview.tsx` â€” Shows the generated project and link to preview
- `src/components/ProjectStructurePanel.tsx` â€” Displays generated file structure

### Hooks & Logic
- `src/hooks/usePastGenerationsFetcher.ts` â€” Manages project CRUD operations
- `src/hooks/useGenerateApp.ts` â€” Handles AI generation workflow
- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` â€” Authentication state management
- `src/lib/interpreterApi.ts` â€” AI API integration
- `src/lib/utils.ts` â€” Utility functions

### Backend & Configuration
- `supabase/functions/interpret-sketch/` â€” AI interpretation edge function
- `supabase/functions/deploy/` â€” Deployment edge function
- `supabase/migrations/` â€” Database schema migrations
- `src/integrations/supabase/` â€” Supabase client and type definitions

## Critical Developer Notes

### Security & Best Practices
- **Database security:** Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced on all tables!
- **Environment variables:** Never commit `.env` files - use `.env.example` as template
- **API keys:** Store sensitive keys in Supabase edge function secrets, not client code
- **Authentication:** All routes validate user sessions before allowing operations
- **Input validation:** All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Never expose your Supabase service key in frontend code!** Use anon key only.

### Architecture Notes
- **AI Integration:** Code generation logic in `src/lib/interpreterApi.ts` and edge functions
- **State Management:** React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Component Structure:** Atomic design pattern - keep components focused and reusable
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Performance:** Lazy loading, code splitting, and optimized re-renders

### Development Workflow
- **Testing:** Implement tests for all new features using Vitest
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier
- **Git Flow:** Feature branches, comprehensive commit messages
- **Documentation:** Update this README for any new features
