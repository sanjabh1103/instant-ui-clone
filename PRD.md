## Reality-to-Code AI Builder Platform

### Overview
Reality-to-Code is an AI-powered web application builder that transforms hand-drawn sketches and wireframes into production-ready React applications. Users can upload sketches, describe functionality, and receive fully functional web applications within minutes.

### Core Features

#### 1. Sketch Upload & Processing
- **Image Upload**: Support for PNG/JPG files up to 5MB
- **Preview System**: Real-time image preview with replace functionality
- **AI Vision**: Advanced computer vision for sketch interpretation

#### 2. Natural Language Processing
- **Prompt Input**: Textarea for describing desired functionality
- **Example Prompts**: Quick-start templates for common use cases
- **Context Understanding**: AI interprets user intent from descriptions

#### 3. Code Generation
- **Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Real-time Generation**: 30-60 second app creation
- **File Structure**: Organized component architecture
- **Production Ready**: Clean, maintainable code output

#### 4. User Authentication & Management
- **Email/Password Auth**: Secure authentication via Supabase
- **Session Management**: Persistent login with auto-refresh
- **Guest Access**: Limited functionality for non-authenticated users

#### 5. Project Management
- **Save Projects**: Persistent storage of generated applications
- **Past Generations**: Browse and reload previous projects
- **Rename/Delete**: Project organization capabilities
- **Live Preview**: Instant preview of generated applications

### Technical Requirements

#### Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on all database tables
- Authenticated-only access to sensitive operations
- Secure session management with cleanup
- Input validation and sanitization

#### Performance
- Optimized image handling and compression
- Lazy loading for project previews
- Responsive design for all devices
- Fast API responses (<2s for most operations)

#### Scalability
- Database indexing on user_id and project_id
- Efficient file storage via Supabase Storage
- CDN integration for static assets

### User Experience

#### Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design from 320px to 4K displays
